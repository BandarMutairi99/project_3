# project_3

This project involves designing a robotic arm using Tinkercad, a 3D modeling tool. The robotic arm consists of a base, two articulated segments (arms), joints, and an end-effector (gripper). The design aims to simulate a basic robotic arm structure that could be used in manufacturing or automation settings.

# Note
The end-effector (final segment of the arm) is not perfectly modeled, I try multiple ways to model the last part of the arm, but I wasnâ€™t able to get it exactly right. Some improvements in shape alignment and rotation are still needed for it to fully resemble a functional gripper.
